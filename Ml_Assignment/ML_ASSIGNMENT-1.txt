ML_ASSIGNMENT 1



What does one mean by the term “machine learning”?

>> Machine Learning is part of an AI system, where we develop algorithms 
and can train that algorithm on the present dataset so it could predict 
the upcoming events.
It is divided into two categories - Supervised (trained on output)and 
Unsupervised(clustering)

2.Can you think of 4 distinct types of issues where it shines?

>> Automation
>> Prediction / forecasting
>> Recommendations
>> Image/Object Recognition

3.What is a labeled training set, and how does it work?

>>Under Supervised learning, we divide data into test and train split , 
where in train dataset the data are labeled and hence to be trained.

4.What are the two most important tasks that are supervised?
  >> Regression and Classification

5.Can you think of four examples of unsupervised tasks?

>> Clustering >> Recommendation >> Dimensionality Reduction >> 
visualisation

6.State the machine learning model that would be best to make a robot walk 
through various
unfamiliar terrains?

>> Reinforced Learning, where with every step the robot will learn .

7.Which algorithm will you use to divide your customers into different 
groups?

>> For customer segmentation we will use UnSupervised Learning and try all 
algos which gives best score

8.Will you consider the problem of spam detection to be a supervised or 
unsupervised learning
problem?

>> Supervised, we need to train with o/p labels

9.What is the concept of an online learning system?

>> where machines learns continuously with the continuous stream of data

10.What is out-of-core learning, and how does it differ from core 
learning?

>>Out-of-core learning system is a system that can handle data that cannot 
fit into your computer memory. It uses online learning system to feed data 
in small bits.

11.What kind of learning algorithm makes predictions using a similarity 
measure?

>> Instance Based Algorithm

12.What’s the difference between a model parameter and a hyperparameter in 
a learning
algorithm?

>> Model Parameter is all set from default, but hyperparameter need to be 
tuned experimentally

13.What are the criteria that model-based learning algorithms look for? 
What is the most popular
method they use to achieve success? What method do they use to make 
predictions?

>> It needs optimal parameters for best predictions, we use cost function 
and try to minimise it, and keep updating the parameters till the cost 
function Is minimized

14.Can you name four of the most important Machine Learning challenges?

>> 	Overfitting the Data (using a model too complicated)
	under fitting
	lack of data
	Non representative Data


15.What happens if the model performs well on the training data but fails 
to generalize the results
to new situations? Can you think of three different options?

>> Model is overfitted on training dataset

We can give more data, change the model, perform better feature 
engineering

16.What exactly is a test set, and why would you need one?

>> test dataset is splitted from original dataset but it doesn’t have o/p 
feature and is used to test the model accuracy

17.What is a validation set’s purpose?

>> compare different models

18.What precisely is the train-dev kit, when will you need it, how do you 
put it to use?

>>Cross-validation is a tool to compare models without needing a separate 
validation set. It is preferred over validation set because we can save 
from breaking of part of the training set to create a validation set, as 
having more data is valuable regardless.

19.What could go wrong if you use the test set to tune hyperparameters?

>>It won’t perform well as the data is the sample of the population
